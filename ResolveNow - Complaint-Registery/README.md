⚙️ Prerequisites and Development Setup

To successfully develop and deploy the ResolveNow online complaint registration and management system, the following tools and technologies must be installed and configured:

🟢 Node.js and npm
Node.js is a high-performance JavaScript runtime environment that enables server-side code execution. npm (Node Package Manager) is used to install and manage project dependencies.

📘 Installation Instructions: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/

🚀 Express.js
Express.js is a minimalist and flexible Node.js web framework for building APIs and web applications. It simplifies backend logic, routing, and middleware integration.
💡 Installation Command: npm install express

🍃 MongoDB
MongoDB is a powerful NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format. It is ideal for handling dynamic data models and large volumes of information.

🛠️ Project Structure and Setup

Frontend (React.js)
1️⃣ Initialize the project using Create React App
2️⃣ Install UI libraries like Axios, Bootstrap, and Material UI
3️⃣ Build reusable UI components for login, registration, dashboard, and complaint submission
4️⃣ Implement routing and navigation using React Router
5️⃣ Integrate with backend API using Axios

Backend (Node.js + Express.js)
1️⃣ Initialize the backend project with npm
2️⃣ Install necessary libraries: Express.js, Mongoose, CORS, Body-parser
3️⃣ Set up server file with middleware and route handling
4️⃣ Implement authentication, CRUD operations, and real-time communication logic

🗂️ Database Schemas

👤 User Schema (user_Schema)
Includes fields: name, email, password, phone, userType

📝 Complaint Schema (complaint_schema)
Includes: userId, name, address, city, state, pincode, comment, status

📌 Assigned Complaint Schema (assigned_complaint)
Includes: agentId, complaintId, status, agentName

💬 Message Schema (message)
Includes: name, message, complaintId

Each schema is stored in its respective MongoDB collection using Mongoose.

🔐 Authentication

Implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or session-based strategies

Includes secure login, registration, and middleware-protected routes

Tokens are stored in browser storage and used for authenticated API requests

🧑‍💼 Admin Features

Assign complaints to available agents

Access and monitor system-wide complaint data

Manage users, statuses, and platform compliance

🧯 Error Handling

Centralized error middleware captures and logs exceptions

Validates request data and returns descriptive HTTP error responses

Common status codes: 400 (Bad Request), 401 (Unauthorized), 404 (Not Found), 500 (Server Error)

🧾 Version Control and Deployment

Use Git for version control and collaboration

GitHub recommended for remote repository management

Deployment options:

Frontend: Vercel, Netlify

Backend: Render, Railway, Heroku

Database: MongoDB Atlas (Cloud-hosted MongoDB)

🖥️ Recommended Development Tools

Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

WebStorm

Sublime Text
